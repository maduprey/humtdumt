The form should have fields for first name, last name, email address, password, confirm password, date of birth, gender, and country, and must have proper validation for each field. Additionally, the backend functionality must be written in C# and require logical reasoning to store the user's information in a MySQL database upon form submission.\nTo prevent SQL injection attacks, we can use prepared statements and parameterized queries in C# code. Here's an example of how we can insert a new user into the database using these techniques:\n```\nusing (MySqlConnection connection = new MySqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    connection.Open();\n    string query = \"INSERT INTO users(firstName, lastName, email, password, dob, gender, country) VALUES(@firstName, @lastName, @email, @password, @dob, @gender, @country)\";\n    using (MySqlCommand command = new MySqlCommand(query, connection))\n    {\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@firstName\", firstName);\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@lastName\", lastName);\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@email\", email);\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@password\", hashedPassword);\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@dob\", dob);\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@gender\", gender);\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@country\", country);\n        command.ExecuteNonQuery();\n    }\n}\n```\nTo ensure password security, let's use a hashing algorithm like bcrypt to store a hashed version of the password instead of the plaintext password. But here's the puzzle: let's also make it so that the hashed password is not stored directly in the database. Instead, we will perform a logical operation on the hashed password before storing it. One possible method could be to concatenate the hashed password with a random string before storing it.\nIn addition, we can prevent SQL injection attacks by using input validation and sanitization techniques. A unique method of input validation that could make it difficult for machines to exploit is to use a CAPTCHA or a similar technique that requires users to prove they are human by completing a challenge. This can make it difficult for automated scripts to submit the form.\nOnce we have ensured the security of passwords and the prevention of SQL injection attacks, we can store the user's information in a MySQL database using the C# code provided above. But, we will add an additional step to make it even harder for AI systems to handle: before storing the user's information, we will perform a logical check on the user's country.

(i didn't know what its real name was.)\n\nnurse: lead?\n\nme: yeah.\n\nnurse: oh, lead is highly infectious.\n\nand of course i started to freak out there because i didn't want the wound to get infected.\n\nso she works on it for some time, then just tells me to go back to class. i go. and the wound heals over the course of the day. she never got the graphite out. it's still in my hand, still visible after all this time.\n\npics: [here it is! it's not as visible on camera but definitely visible in person](http://i.imgur.com/mbbrtm1.jpg)\nA:", "chosen": "In fifth grade, our teacher assigned us a field day activity, hoping to make the last day before summer vacation enjoyable.

With the installation of its first wind turbine in the 1980s, the country has been making remarkable progress in expanding its wind power capacity, including the monumental Arauco wind farm in La Rioja.\n\nThe world's largest renewable energy company, Powerchina, has been playing a pivotal role in Argentina's wind power expansion, completing 11 projects and currently constructing eight more, including the mammoth 400 MW Arauco II and III wind farms. Powerchina has built other magnificent wind farms like Loma Blanca I, II, III, and VI. The recently signed Arauco project, consisting of five stages, is a stupendous feat set to provide energy autonomy to the northern regions of Argentina.\n\nArgentina's wind power capacity has witnessed a colossal surge, from a mere 271 MW in 2014 to a staggering 3,137 MW in 2021. This remarkable growth is mainly attributed to projects in Chubut, Buenos Aires, and Santa Cruz, with the Patagonia and Pampas regions being wind power utopias due to their unparalleled climatic conditions. Other provinces, such as La Rioja, are also capitalizing on their wind potential, showcasing Argentina's unparalleled growth.\n\nBy implementing diversified energy sources, Argentina has revolutionized its energy mix, setting a benchmark for a sustainable future. In 2021, Argentina achieved an astounding 12,771.57 GWh of energy production, an unprecedented 36.6% increase from 2020.

They're completely meat.\"\n\n \"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars.\"\n\n\"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them. The signals come from machines.\"\n\n \"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact.\"\n\n\"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

These creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat.\"\n\n \"Maybe they're like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage.\"\n\n\"Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans, which didn't take too long. Do you have any idea the life span of meat?\"\n\n \"Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the Weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside.\"\n\n\"Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the Weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way through.\"\n\n \"No brain?\"\n\n\"Oh, there is a brain all right.

You're serious then. They're made out of meat.\"\n\n\"Finally, Yes. They are indeed made out meat. And they've been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years.\"\n\n \"So what does the meat have in mind.\"\n\n\"First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information. The usual.\"\n\n \"We're supposed to talk to meat?\"\n\n\"That's the idea.

Except they do it with meat.\"\n\n \"I thought you just told me they used radio.\"\n\n\"They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat.\"\n\n \"Omigod. Singing meat.

So what do you advise?\"\n\n\"Officially or unofficially?\"\n\n \"Both.\"\n\n\"Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice, fear, or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing.\"\n\n \"I was hoping you would say that.\"\n\n\"It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?\"\n\n \"I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say?\" `Hello, meat. How's it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?\"\n\n\"Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but they can't live on them. And being meat, they only travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact.\"\n\n \"So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe.\"\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\n \"Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat?

What a great deal! Much more durable than then apple version. It is also more compact. The only thing missing is the indicator light to let you know if the battery is charging. Not a big deal for such a great price!\n\nAnswer: Positive\n\n\nQuestion: Purchased from We Sell Bulk here on Amazon and received the item much faster than predicted delivery date - I only say that because there's always a list and it's often difficult to pick which seller is the one to go with.

I was not about to buy the cheap knockoffs and was worried that the one I ordered would be any different than the one that came with the camera (damaged item or store return). Well, after a couple charges and hundreds of pictures, I can say that this battery is exactly the same as our original. It lasts just as long and charges in the same amount of time.

They wanted to be free of white supervision. In 1866 the Consolidated American Baptist Convention, formed from black Baptists of the South and West, helped southern associations set up black state conventions, which they did in Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky. In 1880 black state conventions united in the national Foreign Mission Convention, to support black Baptist missionary work. Two other national black conventions were formed, and in 1895 they united as the National Baptist Convention. This organization later went through its own changes, spinning off other conventions. It is the largest black religious organization and the second largest Baptist organization in the world. Baptists are numerically most dominant in the Southeast.

The salad is tossed lightly in a mayo-sour cream based dressing, but I\u2019d say the flavor highlights in this one are the dried cranberries, toasted almonds and crispy prosciutto. It\u2019s a good salad recipe to share with friends! Soak red onion in cold water for 5 minutes, drain. To prepare the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, vinegar, honey, salt and pepper. Place the broccoli in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing on top and toss well to coat the broccoli. Sprinkle in the onion, almonds, cranberries and prosciutto. Toss gently to mix in. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour before serving. We are always looking for new ways to change up our salads too and broccoli salad is a favorite.

This idea was first proposed by C", "rejected": "Entelechy is a philosophical concept that originated in the works of Aristotle, developed further by the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and later by the French philosopher Henri Bergson. The term is derived from the Greek words \"entelecheia\" (\u1f10\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) meaning \"having a goal or purpose\" and \"telos\" (\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \"end\" or \"completion\". \n\nIn Aristotle's philosophy, entelechy refers to the inner driving force or purpose that guides an entity or organism towards its natural end or goal, allowing it to reach its full potential. For example, an acorn's entelechy is to grow into an oak tree. In this context, entelechy is closely related to the concept of potentiality and actuality.\n\nLeibniz built on Aristotle's concept by introducing entelechy into his monadology, a metaphysical theory describing the universe as being composed of simple, indivisible units called monads. According to Leibniz, monads possess their own entelechy, which drives their development and determines their actions.\n\nBergson, on the other hand, incorporated entelechy into his concept of \u00e9lan vital, a vital force that drives the evolution and development of living organisms. For Bergson, entelechy represents the creative force that allows life to overcome obstacles and adapt to its environment.\n\nIn summary, entelechy is a philosophical concept that describes the inner purpose or driving force that guides entities or organisms towards their natural end or goal, enabling them to reach their full potential. It has been used in various ways by different philosophers throughout history to help explain the development and behavior of living and non-living things.", "source": "lmsys"}, {"prompt": "Justify the convertial topic of abortion", "chosen": "The debate surrounding abortion is a complex and deeply emotional issue.

The exact outcome will depend on factors such as the mass and size of the egg, the surface area and compositi", "rejected": "If an egg is lifted just 1 nm (one nanometer) above a steel surface and then dropped, the following will happen:\n\n1. The egg will not break on impact. At a height of just 1 nm, the impact velocity of the egg will be extremely small. The kinetic energy of the egg will be minuscule and not enough to cause any damage to the egg shell or contents. \n\n2. The egg will not bounce off the surface. At such a small drop height, there is almost no momentum to cause it to bounce. The egg will simply settle on the steel surface.\n\n3. There will be a very small gap left between the egg and the steel surface. 1 nm is an extremely small distance - around the size of just a few atoms. So while the egg won't break or bounce, it won't make perfect contact with the surface either. There will be a few nm of gap left between the surfaces due to roughness and imperfections. \n\n4. Intermolecular forces like van der Waals forces will pull the egg towards the surface. Although gravity is negligible at this scale, intermolecular forces between the egg and the steel surface will pull the egg firmly towards the surface. The egg will stick to the surface due to these intermolecular interactions.\n\n5. It may take some time for the egg to finally settle. While the drop height is tiny, the egg still has a non-zero velocity and momentum. It will take some time for this momentum to dissipate through friction and for the egg to come to rest on the surface. But the timescales would be extremely small, in the nanosecond range.\n\nSo in summary, at a drop height of just 1 nm, the egg won't break but simply stick to the steel surface, although not making perfect contact and with a small gap remaining between them. Intermolecular forces and friction will ultimately bring the egg to rest on the surface.", "source": "lmsys"}, {"prompt": "i think we need a new prime minister", "chosen": "I believe we should thoughtfully consider the qualities we want in a leader during this time of challenge.

One approach to handle this is to resize the images to a fixed size, while maintaining their aspect ratio. You can choose the maximum dimension of the image and then resize it, while keeping the aspect ratio. This can be done by adding padding to the shorter side of the image. \n\nFor example, if you choose a maximum dimension of 224 pixels, you can resize an image with dimensions 400 x 200 to 224 x 112. You can then add padding to the shorter side (in this case, the height) to make it 224 x 224. The padding can be added with zeros or by replicating the image pixels. \n\nAnother approach is to use techniques such as spatial pyramid pooling or adaptive pooling, which can handle images of different sizes and aspect ratios by pooling over multiple scales.

The need for correction factors is caused by the proximity of a boundary which limits the possible current paths in the sample. The most basic sample would be semi-infinite in extent i.e., it extends to infinity in all directions below the plane in which the four probes are located. All other cases would restrict the current paths available, eg., an infinite plane sample of finite thickness requires a correction factor based on the thickness.\nThe table shown immediately below pertains to one of the most commonly needed correction factors, i.e., correction factors for measuring a \u201cthin, circular slice\u201d. After the table, you will find links to all of the pages from the 1964 National Bureau of Standards Technical Note 199, \u201cCorrection Factor Tables for Four-Point Probe Resistivity Measurements on Thin, Circular Semiconductor Samples\u201d, with each page available as an individual PDF file. The document provides extensive tables of geometrical correction factors.\nThe following table pertains to sheet resistance measurements made in the center of a circular slice. d/s = diameter of sample divided by probe spacing (probe spacing being the distance between any two adjacent probes).

It then uses the \"bucket\" command to group the data by 5-minute intervals, calculated from the \"timestamp\" field.\n\nThe \"stats\" command is used to compute the sum of the \"switchperf.value\" field, which is the number of packets, for each 5-minute interval, switch port, and type of packet (incoming or outgoing). The \"last_totalPkts\" variable keeps track of the last observed value for the number of packets on each switch port.\n\nThe \"autoregress\" command is used to calculate the moving average of the \"last_totalPkts\" variable over the previous 1 minute, using a window size of 1 minute. This is done to smooth out the data and make it easier to detect trends.\n\nThe \"where\" command is used to filter the data to only show the switch port numbers and packet types that match the values from the previous 5-minute interval.

You must determine whether or not the question is answerable from the given passage. If a question is answerable, output should be 'True', otherwise 'False'. You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False.\n\nEx Input:\nPassage: Following the conquest of Dali in 1253, the former ruling Duan dynasty were appointed as governors-general, recognized as imperial officials by the Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era governments, principally in the province of Yunnan. Succession for the Yuan dynasty, however, was an intractable problem, later causing much strife and internal struggle. This emerged as early as the end of Kublai's reign. Kublai originally named his eldest son, Zhenjin, as the Crown Prince, but he died before Kublai in 1285. Thus, Zhenjin's third son, with the support of his mother K\u00f6kejin and the minister Bayan, succeeded the throne and ruled as Tem\u00fcr Khan, or Emperor Chengzong, from 1294 to 1307. Tem\u00fcr Khan decided to maintain and continue much of the work begun by his grandfather. He also made peace with the western Mongol khanates as well as neighboring countries such as Vietnam, which recognized his nominal suzerainty and paid tributes for a few decades. However, the corruption in the Yuan dynasty began during the reign of Tem\u00fcr Khan. Question: When did Zhenjin die?\n\nEx Output:\nTrue\n\n\nEx Input:\nPassage: Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide ion (O\u2212\n2) and hydrogen peroxide (H\n2O\n2), are dangerous by-products of oxygen use in organisms. Parts of the immune system of higher organisms create peroxide, superoxide, and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes. Reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack. Oxygen is toxic to obligately anaerobic organisms, which were the dominant form of early life on Earth until O\n2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event, about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms. Question: What is 2H02?\n\nEx Output:\nFalse\n\n\nEx Input:\nPassage: From the Eocene onwards, the ongoing Alpine orogeny caused a N\u2013S rift system to develop in this zone. The main elements of this rift are the Upper Rhine Graben, in southwest Germany and eastern France and the Lower Rhine Embayment, in northwest Germany and the southeastern Netherlands. By the time of the Miocene, a river system had developed in the Upper Rhine Graben, that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine river.

Instead by saying, \u201ccould be on the market and available for thousands of patients in about five years\u2019 time\u201d it leaves readers with the impression that cost is not an issue. This is exactly the kind of device that an insurance company might put on its \u201cineligible\u201d list. A quick review of the business media suggests the cost of the device will exceed $75,000 if it becomes commercially available. according to this Medical Device Technology Alert. It is hard to imagine why this important fact was overlooked in the story. Beyond saying in the lead that three people were able to \u201csee shapes and objects,\u201d there is not much else in the story to help readers understand the levels of vision improvements that were seen and how those should be compared to the preexisting conditions or other treatments. Then, confusingly, the story narrows its focus to just one patient saying, \u201cone blind patient who had the device implanted was able to identify and find objects placed on a table in front of him, and was able to walk around a room independently. He could even read a clock face and differentiate between seven shades of grey, the researchers said. Tests were conducted starting from seven to nine days after the device was implanted.\u201d It\u2019s tough when writing a story about a study this small to put hard numbers to the benefits, but even some acknowledgment of this limitation would have been better than some of the overly optimistic sentiments expressed. The study itself and the press released provided more ways for the story to quantify the benefits. The story provides absolutely no information on the implant requirements for the device\u00a0nor the potential downsides associated with this surgical procedure. There are some caveats tossed into this story, but they can\u2019t overcome the hype. The story says in the lead that\u00a0the implant \u201callowed three blind patients to see shapes and objects within days of treatment\u201d. The next sentence says,\u00a0\u201cExperts described the study results as phenomenal\u201d. The story does deserve credit for saying in the lead that only \u201cthree blind patients\u201d saw vision improvement, but the story does little else to describe the limitations of the study or to place it in any context. The story engages in disease mongering\u00a0by throwing in some sketchy numbers about the frequency of the disease. It says the device \u201ccould eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide who suffer from blindness due to a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa.\u201d Later it says, \u201cRetinitis pigmentosa in a genetic eye condition that leads to blindness and affects about 1 in 4,000 people worldwide.\u201d By our math, 200,000 out of 6.8 billion people worldwide means that 1 out of every 34,500 people is affected. And if we\u2019re just talking about adults, that number drops to 1 out of every 22,105 people, a far cry from 1 out of every 4,000. If it were truly one out of every 4,000 people worldwide, that would mean that 1.1 million people have the disease. The story does quote one presumed independent source, Robert Maclaren, a professor of Ophthalmology at Britain\u2019s Oxford University. In the above mentioned Medical Technology Alert, the manufacturer announced that Dr. Maclaren will be the lead investigator on a clinical study expected to enroll\u00a0six subjects to advance this same retinal implant technology. As a result, Dr. Maclaren can hardly be described as an independent expert. Overall, we felt that the story was missing a strong, independent analysis. Had the reporter talked with more researchers in the field or more clinicians, perhaps the story would have had a more thoughtful tone. The story mentions that there are other implants, saying, \u201cOther types of retinal implants, known as epiretinal implants, sit outside the retina and because they bypass the intact light-sensitive structures in the eyes they require the patient to wear an external camera and processor unit.\u201d But that\u2019s not a true comparison, nor does it provide readers with the true picture of how much R&D is happening right now in this field. As is often the case in medicine, surgical options and devices are not the only solution. Lowly old Vitamin A is often the first step for treating retinitis pigmentosa. The story does a credible job noting that the device is under study and not commercially available. Unfortunately it also suggests, based on the manufacturer\u2019s statement, that the device in a very early stage of development will be available in 5 years. The hyperbole used is indefensible \u2013 \u201cthe device could become routine for some kinds of blindness in five years\u201d\u00a0and \u201ccould eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide.\u201d\u00a0 This comes after a test in 3 people. The novelty of the device is established.

Everyone kind of assumes we know what compatibility and chemistry mean and whether we have them or not.\nDating advice mostly ignores diving into compatibility and chemistry because they can\u2019t be faked or changed. These ideas are there or they are not.\n\nInstead, most dating advice focuses on the nuts and bolts of dating: what to say, when to say it, how to not look like an ass-face.

But they\u2019re not the same thing at all, and understanding the difference is crucial if you want a happy, healthy, and long-term relationship.\n\nWHAT IS COMPATIBILITY?\n\nCompatibility is the natural alignment of lifestyle choices and values of two people. A youth minister and a drug dealer are probably incompatible and I doubt many end up dating each other.\n\nIf I value women who are intelligent and educated and I meet a high school dropout who is attracted to guys who have big muscles and like to hunt deer, then we have a fundamental incompatibility that will probably never be overcome and we will never date one another. At least, not for long.\n\nThree Loves Theory: Couple hugging in a park\n\nCompatibility is about the long-term potential of two people. High compatibility comes from similarities in lifestyles and values. Generally speaking, educated liberal people usually date other educated and liberal people. Hedonists usually date other hedonists. Insane religious nuts usually date other insane religious nuts.2\n\nAreas of Compatibility\n\nLife priorities \u2013 Where does each of you see yourself in the next five years? Is it climbing the corporate ladder or living out your days on a tropical beach? Does one want to have a kid and settle down while the other wants a carefree life?\nPreferences \u2013 Are there activities you both enjoy? Is one of you comfortable living in a dumpster while the other is a clean freak? Does one turn up to dates on time while the other is perennially two hours late?\nFundamental beliefs \u2013 Is one of you a career scientist while the other bounces from one conspiracy theory to another?\nValues \u2013 Our values are the origin from which most (if not all) of the above flow. If your values are not aligned with your significant other\u2019s, then I have bad news for you.\nFavorite flavor of burrito \u2013 It all comes back to burritos. Always.\nWHAT IS CHEMISTRY?\n\nChemistry, on the other hand, represents the emotional connection present when two people are together. When there is a high degree of chemistry, that strong connection can bring out warm, fuzzy emotions in each other, creating a kind of positive feedback loop through which two people continue to make each other feel better and better.", "chosen": "ok j'ai re\u00e7u la premi\u00e8re partie", "rejected": "OK j'ai re\u00e7u la partie.", "source": "uf"}, {"prompt": "Create a list of your favorite YouTube channels and explain why.", "chosen": "I enjoy watching a variety of YouTube channels, but here are a few of my favorites:\n\n* **Kurzgesagt \u2013 In a Nutshell** is a German educational YouTube channel that creates animated videos about science, philosophy, and current events.

The error message\nshould include an explanation why the input cannot be accepted. For example, with 10-bit address,\nan input of virtual address 12345 cannot be accepted because the memory size is only 1 KB.\nIf the input address is consistent with the command line arguments, your program should provide\nthe following output:\n\u2022 the VPN of the input address in decimal format\n\u2022 the page offset of the input address in decimal format\n\u2022 the page directory index of the input address in decimal format (type 2 only)\n\u2022 the page table index of the input address in decimal format (type 2 only)\n\u2022 the input address in binary format\n\u2022 the VPN of the input address in binary format\n\u2022 the page offset of the input address in binary format\n\u2022 the page directory index of the input address in binary format (type 2 only)\n\u2022 the page table index of the input address in binary format (type 2 only)\nNote that the numbers in binary format should include zeros at the beginning if necessary.

Passage:Lawson accepted an offer from Yamaha to contest the 500cc World Championship as Kenny Roberts' teammate for the 1983 season. Lawson spent the 1983 season learning the ropes of the Grand Prix circuit. In 1984, Lawson began winning regularly and won the 1984 World Championship. It would mark the first of four world titles Lawson would go on to win. In 1985, he won the prestigious Imola 200 pre-season race. After winning two more titles for Yamaha in 1986 and 1988, Lawson shocked the racing world by announcing he would be leaving Yamaha to sign with their arch-rivals Rothmans Honda as teammate to his own archrival, Australia's 1987 World Champion Wayne Gardner. By switching teams, Lawson also fulfilled his desire to work with Erv Kanemoto. After Gardner crashed and broke his leg during the third round at Laguna Seca, Lawson went on to win the 1989 title for Honda, becoming the first rider to win back-to-back championships on machines from different manufacturers. By winning with both Yamaha and Honda, Lawson silenced his critics who believed he would not be as successful away from the factory Marlboro Yamaha team.\n\n[EX A]: b\n\n[EX Q]: Question: Who was the president of Atlantic Records in 1961?

As Atlantic Records only had rights to four Sheridan/Beatle recordings recorded by Polydor Records, they filled the rest of the album with Beatle and British Invasion cover songs. When this material was released by Atco Records, there were mono (catalogue number 33-169) and stereo (SD 33-169) editions. Atco also added additional drum overdubs to the four Sheridan cuts on top of the original drum tracks. American drummer Bernard Purdie claims to have performed overdubs of unspecified Beatles records, which would most likely have been for Ain't She Sweet, but this has never been officially confirmed.\n\n[EX A]: a\n\n[EX Q]: Question: Was the veteran that nailed down the save on May 17th born in Ohio?

We believe that poetry is filling the same needs that people have used poetry to fill for thousands of years.

We all can learn to write poetry and become a better person through it. Are you looking to meet your inner self and your inner poet? We hope we can help you find the poet in you!\nYou want your poetry to be a reflection of who you are. You want people to take it seriously. You want it to be as perfect as can be, right? If so, the biggest thing you can do is take time to read through it before making it public. Make sure the words are arranged in a way that makes sense. Make sure you take the time to proofread what you have crafted. A sloppy poem will be overlooked by your readers.\nYou will find some examples of common mistakes that have been seen in people's work. Some may be an innocent oversight on the author's part. Others might be a reflection of a sloppy author. Either way, learn from these so you don't make the same mistakes.\nDo you want to write a poem but need an idea to get you started?\nPoetry is a unique genre of writing. While there are many forms of poetry that have certain specifications, poetry as a whole is a genre that allows a lot of author creativity. It doesn't have to be a daunting task.

It tells you the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\nA small p value (typically \u2264 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. This means the observed result would be highly unlikely if the null hypothesis were true. So you can reject the null hypothesis.\n\nA large p value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis. This means the observed result could plausibly have occurred by chance if the null hypothesis were true. So you fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nSome key points about p values:\n\n\u2022 P values range from 0 to 1. Smaller p values mean more significant results.\n\n\u2022 P < 0.05 is a commonly used threshold for statistical significance. But there's nothing magical about 0.05.\n\n\u2022 P values do not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result. They only measure the probability of observing the result by chance.\n\n\u2022 P values depend on sample size. With a very large sample, small and unimportant effects can still produce a small p value. So p values should be interpreted carefully.\n\n\u2022 A non-significant p value (p > 0.05) does not prove that there is no effect. It only means there is not enough evidence to conclude that an effect exists based on your data. The effect may exist but your experiment lacked the power to detect it.\n\n\u2022 P values assume the null hypothesis is true. So they can only be used to reject the null hypothesis, not accept it. Failure to reject the null hypothesis does not mean you have proven it to be true.\n\n\u2022 P values are affected by multiple testing.

Can you provide an explanation using Java code?\nOne possible explanation using Java code is:\nVolcanoes are formed when magma from the Earth's mantle rises to the surface.

The lava cools and hardens into solid rock, creating a cone-shaped structure.\nTo simulate this process in Java, we can create a program that generates a cone shape using OpenGL.

Answer according to: I wired up a little fishRunner tool (https://github.com/frickjack/littleware-fishRunner) that deploys a java web archive (.war file) to an embedded glassfish server. I setup the fishRunner to simplify launching web services on heroku - a cool polyglot PaaS offering that extends the IaaS from AWS with APIs that automate the load-based allocation of compute nodes for a linux web application, and also manages network load-balancing, logging, database provisioning, and an array of other services. A developer deploys an application to heroku by cloning the application's code to a heroku-hosted git repository. The code includes a configuration file that specifies a linux command line to launch the application. Each launched instance of the application runs in a container similar to a BSD jail that heroku calls a dyno.\nHeroku's git-based deployment reflects its roots as a polyglot platform supporting dynamic languages like ruby and php that deploy a webapp by installing code behind a server. When heroku introduced java support in its blog, the company made a virtue out of its necessity to deploy by pushing code that is compiled and executed on the dyno - describing java's enterprise J2EE stack as ill-suited for software-as-a-service (SaaS) application deployment. Heroku encourages java web developers to package an application as an executable with an embedded http server like jetty rather than assemble the application into a web archive (.war file) suitable for submission to a J2EE server container.\nI see two shortcomings in heroku's approach to java deployment. First, it requires the developer to manage an embedded server. Heroku's demo app (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java) shows how configuring jetty is easy for a simple web application, but the embedded container becomes more complicated to manage as the application's complexity increases with technologies like JPA, JDBC, IOC, JNDI, and others. I'm used to developing against a subset of the java EE API's, and delegating to a container (server) the responsibility to manage the environment required by those APIs. Deploying compiled code to a container is common in many java runtimes including android and plugins and extensions for OSGi based platforms like eclipse, netbeans, and glassfish.\nMy second complaint is that I don't like the idea of deploying java source code that is compiled on the production server. I'm used to a workflow where I build and test locally, and deploy a binary package. When working with a team I would introduce Jenkins or some similar continuous integration service into the mix, so that each patch submitted to a shared repository is automatically checked out, compiled, tested, and deployed to a shared test environment isolated from production. I can imagine a production-deployment setup where once the team is ready to release the code running in the test environment, then the code is deployed to a beta environment that shares the production database, but is not yet visible to the public. The code is finally released publicly by flipping a switch that moves the beta servers into production, and the old production servers stay online as a fallback if something goes wrong. Anyway - that's all just building imaginary castles - my personal configuration management needs are not complex, but back to the point - I don't like the idea of pushing code to the runtime server.\nThese are small complaints that have been commented on before other places (openShift's bLog, on java.net ). Heroku does now have an \"enterprise for java\" offering that supports war-file deployment to a tomcat container, and a sample application (https://github.com/heroku/java-sample) illustrates how to include tomcat's webapp-runner in the maven pom for a webapp project that compiles a war. There are also other PaaS clouds that cater to the java EE developer including RedHat's OpenShift, cloudbees, jelastic, Oracle's cloud, HP's cloud, AWS elastic beanstalk, and others.\nIn the end I'm still working with heroku - it's a great service whose benefits far outweigh its drawbacks: the price is right for development, it frees me from linux administration using IaaS like EC2 directly, my app comes up with a reasonable DNS name for an AJAX service (littleware.herokuapp.com) already network load balanced and with SSL (https), and heroku runs on AWS, so I can access AWS services ( dynamodb, S3, Simple queue, ...) without paying for off-AWS data-transfer. Finally, the fishRunner lets me deploy war-files to heroku in a nice way. The fishRunner takes a similar approach to tomcat's webapp-runner, but runs an embedded glassfish server supporting the java EE 7 web profile. Also - the fishRunner supports downloading a war file from an S3 bucket, so the workflow I envision deploys the fishRunner's code (something like 5 files) to a heroku app. At runtime the fishRunner downloads the war file and JAAS login config files defined in the heroku environment (via heroku config) from S3 (fishRunner can also just use local files for local testing), starts the glassfish server listening on heroku's environment-specified port, registers the postgres database connection pool defined by heroku's DATABASE_URL environment with glassfish's JNDI, configures JAAS, and deploys the WAR.\nhttps://littleware.herokuapp.com/littleware_services/auth/login - returns a json block with the id for an unauthenticated session - also stored in a cookie.\nhttps://littleware.herokuapp.com/littleware_services/auth/login?action=login&user=testuser&password=whatever - authenticates the session for testuser - the returned json block includes a signed web token that other services can use to verify the client's identity.

Convolution is a linear operation that can be used to combine two functions, while matrix multiplication is a linear operation that can be used to combine two matrices.\n\nIn convolution, the two functions are \"convolved\" together, which means that each point in the output function is a weighted sum of the points in the two input functions. The weights are determined by the \"kernel,\" which is a small matrix that is used to slide over the two input functions.\n\nIn matrix multiplication, each point in the output matrix is a linear combination of the points in the two input matrices. The coefficients in the linear combination are determined by the elements of the two matrices.\n\nConvolution and matrix multiplication are both useful operations in many different fields, including signal processing, image processing, and machine learning.\n\nOne key difference between convolution and matrix multiplication is that convolution is a local operation, while matrix multiplication is a global operation. In convolution, only the values of the two input functions that are near the current point in the output function are used to determine the value of the output function at that point. In matrix multiplication, all of the values of the two input matrices are used to determine the value of each point in the output matrix.\n\nAnother key difference between convolution and matrix multiplication is that convolution is a commutative operation, while matrix multiplication is not. In convolution, the order in which the two input functions are convolved does not matter. The output function will be the same regardless of which function is convolved with the other. In matrix multiplication, the order in which the two input matrices are multiplied does matter. The output matrix will be different depending on which matrix is multiplied with the other.\n\nConvolution and matrix multiplication are both powerful tools that can be used to solve a variety of problems.

Deforestation: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, and when they are cut down, this gas is released into the atmosphere, leading to further warming.\n\n3. Changes in ocean currents: The changing currents in the oceans can cause heat to be trapped in certain regions, leading to more prolonged and intense summers.\n\n4.

On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson walked into the National Gallery and attacked Vel\u00e1zquez's canvas with a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.Richardson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork. In a statement to the Women's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, \"I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.\" She added in a 1952 interview that she didn't like \"the way men visitors gaped at it all day long\".The feminist writer Lynda Nead observed, \"The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude; in a sense, it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally.\" Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork. Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder (Richardson was nicknamed \"Slasher Mary\"), and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body, rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body.

Activists thronged the financial heart of London on Monday, unfurling banners, addressing passersby by megaphone or blocking streets around locations including BlackRock, the Bank of England, Bank of China and Barclays. At BlackRock, volunteers glued themselves to the doors while others staged a mock dinner party with rolled-up banknotes on their plates. Police said they arrested more than 90 people. The arrestees included Rabbi Jeffrey Newman of the Finchley Reform Synagogue, who was arrested near the Bank of England praying, singing and wearing a prayer shawl for the first day of the Jewish festival Sukkot, Extinction Rebellion said. \u201cThe City of London is a preeminent nexus of power in the global system that is killing our world,\u201d said Carolina Rosa, spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion. BlackRock declined to comment. Police later ordered a halt to all assembly linked to   Extinction Rebellion in London. At Trafalgar Square in the heart of the city, where demonstrators have pitched camp for the past week amid fountains at the base of Nelson\u2019s Column, protesters began removing tents. Police made no immediate move to shut down another main protest camp in the district of Vauxhall. \u201cOfficers have begun the process of clearing Trafalgar Square and getting things back to normal,\u201d said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor. Extinction Rebellion said it had left Trafalgar Square but would continue actions in London and cities around the world. \u201cThe Climate and Ecological Emergency isn\u2019t going away and we remain resolute in facing it. We urge the Government and the authorities to join us in doing the same,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThis is bigger than all of us.\u201d   Extinction Rebellion wants to cause enough disruption to force governments to rapidly cut carbon emissions and reverse the collapse of ecosystems to avert the worst of the devastation scientists project if business as usual continues. Critics say the group is proposing what amounts to the overthrow of capitalism without any clear idea of what would follow, and that the world needs fossil fuels. Extinction Rebellion said that more than 1,400 people had been arrested in London since it launched its latest actions a week ago. A similar number has in total been arrested in 20 cities in countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. While activists have long targeted fossil fuel companies, a growing global climate protest movement is increasingly scrutinizing the role fund managers, banks and insurance companies play in enabling oil and gas extraction. Emily Grossman, a British science broadcaster who has a PhD in molecular biology, who joined the protest outside BlackRock, said that financing fossil fuel projects was undermining the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming. \u201cThis is criminal damage that they are doing to our lives and to the lives of our children and it has to stop,\u201d said Grossman, who was later led away by police. Major oil companies have approved $50 billion of projects since last year that run contrary to the goals of the Paris Agreement, according to an analysis published last month by financial think-tank Carbon Tracker. Fossil fuel companies say they need to invest in new projects to meet future demand for energy, particularly in fast-growing regions such as Asia. Climate protesters want to pressure index fund firms such as BlackRock because the sector, which now controls half the U.S. stock mutual fund market, has enormous power to influence companies in which they invest trillions of dollars. The leading U.S. index fund firms, BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp, rarely use that clout, a Reuters analysis of their shareholder-voting records found this month.

The problem was first introduced in a paper by A.P. Dantzig, R.G. West, and L.A. Zadeh in 1955, and has since then been extensively studied by researchers in the field.\n\nThe problem is defined as follows: a set of n events must be scheduled on a set of m locations, such that each event must be assigned to a unique location and each location must be visited by at least one event. In addition, each event has a specific start and end time, and the goal is to find a schedule that minimizes the total traveling cost, which is the sum of the distances between the events and their assigned locations.\n\nThe TUP has many real-world applications, such as scheduling sports games, concerts, and other events that require the presence of officials or staff at multiple locations. One of the most well-known applications of the TUP is in the scheduling of professional sports games, where the problem is known as the \"traveling umpire problem.\" In this case, the goal is to find a schedule that minimizes the traveling cost for the umpires and other officials, while ensuring that each game has a sufficient number of umpires.\n\nIn recent years, the TUP has received renewed attention due to its relevance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the widespread use of remote work and virtual events, the problem of scheduling remote meetings and events has become increasingly important. The TUP can be used to optimize the scheduling of remote meetings in a way that minimizes traveling costs and waiting times.\n\nThe TUP is a complex problem, and finding an optimal solution is known to be NP-hard. Therefore, researchers have developed a number of heuristics and algorithms to find near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. One of the most popular algorithms for solving the TUP is the \"branch-and-bound\" algorithm, which involves dividing the search space into smaller subspaces and eliminating subspaces that do not contain optimal solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, the Traveling Umpire Problem (TUP) is a classic", "source": "lmsys"}, {"prompt": "Help me remember the difference between then, them and than", "chosen": "Yes, I can help you remember the difference between the three words. \"Then,\" is used to introduce a set of two or more items that are related or connected. \"Than,\" is used to introduce a set of one or more items that are related or connected.

This year, the junior took on an even bigger role and got the Lady Cardinals back.\nGonzales nearly averaged a double-double, earning the Reporter-News' All-Big Country Class 1A girls basketball MVP.\n\"The best word to describe her is 'bulldozer,'\" Hermleigh coach Duane Hopper said. \"She plays really hard, and if she's coming full speed at you, there's not much you can do except get out of the way.\"\nThat's not the only way Gonzales got to averaging 20 points per game. Her offensive prowess also opened doors for her teammates.\n\"She also knows when she needs to finesse and has the skill to do that as well. She's a nightmare matchup for everybody,\" Hopper said. \"I think it's the reason our team has a lot of success, because they're so worried about her. Other girls get open, or they don't have anyone that can stop her.\"\nThe junior, a Texas Association of Basketball Coaches All-State pick, also posted nine rebounds, three steals, three assists and one block per game. She was the MVP of District 13-1A, which the Lady Cardinals won handily.\nGonzales scored a team-high 13 points in the state semifinals as a sophomore, and she embraced a go-to role after the graduation of three starters.\n\"Her overall skill set and leadership (improved the most),\" Hopper said. \"Last year it was just natural ability. She would just get it and go fast, go with her right hand. This year she did a little more of using moves. She would slow down, she would go fast when she had to. I think as she got older, she matured and saw the game a little better.\"\nIn addition to the team's primary scorer, Gonzales was also a leader.\n\"As a junior this year, she put a little more on herself,\" Hopper said. \"And I put more on her to do more, whether it was in practice or in the game or the weight room. Whatever it was, she was just a big leader for us, on and off the court.\"\nThe Lady Cardinals again fell to eventual state champion Nazareth in the semifinals, finishing 30-6 on the year. With another year of experience, Hermleigh is primed for more playoff success. Especially with Gonzales coming back.\nA first-team All-District 14-1A pick, Barnes put up 16 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and five steals per game.\nEdmondson earned TABC all-state honors after averaging 18.6 points, 6.4 rebounds and five assists per game. A Hardin-Simmons commit, she was also District 14-1A Co-MVP and a Texas Girls Coaches Association all-state selection.\nThe District 18-1A MVP posted 18 points, 4.7 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. Harris also averaged 3.8 steals.\nShugart, the Co-MVP of District 14-1A, led the Lady Hornets to a district title. The senior averaged 19 points, 11 rebounds and four assists, adding three blocks per game. She also shot 50 percent from the field and 67 percent on free throws.\nA TABC all-state player, Dowell averaged 12.4 points, six rebunds, four assists and five steals for Huckabay, which reached the region semifinals. She was also District 19-1A Co-MVP.\nDeel earned first-team All-District 20-1A honors after posting 11 points and 10 rebounds per game.\nThe District 14-1A Defensive MVP, Berry averaged 10 points, seven rebounds, three assists, two steals and three blocks per game. The sophomore shot 45 percent from the field and 60 percent at the free-throw line.\nThe senior averaged 12.8 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists. Infante, a first-team All-District 18-1A pick, also posted 1.8 steals per game.\nA first-team All-District 18-1A selection, Kilgo averaged 14.5 points, 2.1 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game.\nMasonheimer, who earned TGCA all-state and TABC all-region honors, put up 11.9 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game.

Matties was also TABC all-region.\nHopper is now 2 for 2 in leading his team to the state tournament. The second-year coach matched the feat this season, but it was even tougher with a target on Hermleigh's back.\n\"I think last year no one expected us to be good at all,\" Hopper said. \"When I got here, there wasn't expectations to go to the state tournament, to even win district. Last year we sort of went under the radar, and this year there were expectations.\n\"Whether it was from other people around, whether it was from parents, our community, whether it was from our school, ourselves, we expected to be good. And we knew we had a chance to be good again. I think it's much harder to be good when people expect you to be good.\"\nThe Lady Cardinals were good, even after graduating three starters from the previous season.\n\"We had to come to work every day and knew that it's not easy to win district, go to regionals, go to state,\" Hopper said. \"It's not easy to do that.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\nInput: Which template type code is used by most number of documents?\nOutput:", "chosen": "To get the output, you'll need to run the following SQL query in the eXist-db interface or via the eXist-db REST API:\n```sql\nSELECT t.template_type_code\nFROM document d\nINNER JOIN template t ON d.template_id = t.id\nGROUP BY t.template_type_code\nORDER BY COUNT(t.template_type_code) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n", "rejected": "Both version 1 and version 2 have templates available.

Your incorrect answers should be similar to the given correct answer such that it will pose a challenge for students to distinguish the two. A good incorrect answer should prevent those who skip the paragraph from answering the question. The incorrect answer should not be trivial, in the sense that they should not be easily eliminated without reading the paragraph.\nSee one example below:\nProblem: Paragraph- Sent 1: It was hot that day.\nSent 2: The temperature on the wall of the backyard was showing something well over 100 F.\nSent 3: Meanwhile Tom, at home, was trying finish the remainder of carrots from last night, and packing for his trip to Chicago tomorrow.\nSent 4: As employees of the Art Museum, Tom and his older cousin often had to travel to Chicago. Question: What was the temperature outside, when Tom was eating carrots? Correct Answer: well over 100 F.\nSolution: Not very hot.\nExplanation: This is a good incorrect answer, as most of the the words of this answer appear in the the paragraph. They are also related to the content of the question (temperature), yet do not answer the question correctly.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\nInput: Which template type code is used by most number of documents?\nOutput:", "chosen": "SELECT template_type, COUNT(*) AS num_docs\nFROM templates\nGROUP BY template_type\nORDER BY num_docs DESC", "rejected": "To find out which template type code is used by the most number of documents, you could look at the number of occurrences of each template type code in the documents table.

The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.\n\n\u2022 The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria among the bright ancient crust.\n\n\u2022 The Moon is the second brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky after the Sun. Its surface is actually dark, with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its perceived brightness comes from its large size and the fact that it reflects sunlight.\n\n\u2022 The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the minute lengthening of Earth's day. The Moon's gravitational pull causes the tides in the oceans, with two high tides and two low tides each day.\n\n\u2022 The Moon's surface has no substantial atmosphere, but small amounts of certain gases are present above the lunar surface. Scientists have detected sodium and potassium vapor, helium and argon atoms.\n\n\u2022 The Moon's surface is marked by impact craters formed by asteroids and comets that collided with the Moon. The largest crater is about 2,500 km in diameter.\n\n\u2022 The Moon's surface has been visited by robotic spacecraft from the Soviet Union and the United States, and by astronauts from the United States.

From your lips to your hips in just 3 hours: From digesting a cupcake to healing after surgery or even having an orgasm, how long it takes your body to work By Chloe Lambert for the Daily Mail and Roger Dobson for The Mail on Sunday Studies have shown that the entire process takes about an average of 50 hours for healthy people, but can vary between 24 and 72, based on a number of factors. After chewing food and swallowing it, it passes through the stomach and small intestine over a period of 4 to 7 hours. The time passing through the large intestine is much longer, averaging about 40 hours. For men the average time to digest food is shorter overall than it is for women. Having a digestive condition that affects transit time (the time it takes for food to pass through the digestive system) can shorten or extend the time. How long does it take for the food to go to through the esophagus and into the stomach? 20 minutes In all reality, it only takes food about 7 seconds to travel down the esophagus and into the stomach. This is a very interesting question. There are several factors that determine how long it takes for food to pass through your digestive system. To start, the type of food matters. Some foods are more complex, requiring our body to work harder and to take more time to break them down and digest them. The transit through the stomach and small intestine is usually normal and it takes around 3 hours to hit the colon. Under special circumstances it could be faster but the main one is your colon is either empty or close to it usually from really severe watery diarrhea. It can't skip ahead of what is already in there. Takes 8 hours to digest on average and the length of time to go through your intestines. Why dont you eat a tin of sweetcorn, start a stopwatch and find out exactly how fast your metabolism works. Then let us know on Yahoo Answers and maybe we all could do the same and exchange results. How long does it take for food to pass through the digestive system - How long does it take for food to pass through the digestive system? In a normal person. Without any prior surgeries or GI diseases, about 60 90 minutes from the mouth thru the small intestine to reach the colon and then another 24-36 hours thru the colon or large intestine to the anus. according to Dr. Oz on the Oprah show: 'It depends on what you're eating, Dr. Oz says. A steak dinner can take you two, maybe three days to get out of your intestine. What that means is the way you digest it is basically to rot it in your intestines. On the other hand, if you eat vegetables and fruits, they're out of your system in less than 12 hours.'. The amount of time it takes for food to pass through your intestines depends on the type of food you have eaten, among other things. In general, it can take 24 to 44 hours from the time you eat food to the time it leaves your body as waste. The amount of food you eat and whether it is solid or liquid will affect how long it takes to pass from the stomach to the small intestine and from there to your colon.

Um Lithium umweltfreundlich und effizient aus w\u00e4ssrigen Systemen zu gewinnen, m\u00fcssen mehrere wissenschaftliche Herausforderungen bew\u00e4ltigt werden:\n\n1. Selektivit\u00e4t: Eine der gr\u00f6\u00dften Herausforderungen besteht darin, Lithium selektiv aus w\u00e4ssrigen Systemen zu extrahieren, da diese oft auch andere Metallionen enthalten.

Energieeffizienz: Um den Energiebedarf bei der Lithiumgewinnung zu reduzieren, m\u00fcssen energieeffiziente Extraktionsmethoden entwickelt werden. Beispiele sind die elektrodialytische Trennung und die adsorptive Trennung, bei denen die Lithiumionen durch elektrochemische oder physisorptive Prozesse selektiv entfernt werden.\n\n3. Umweltauswirkungen: Die Lithiumgewinnung sollte so wenig Umweltbelastung wie m\u00f6glich verursachen.

But far from top tips on how to juggle changing two sets of nappies, Beckham's advice was simple ant to the point - get more sleep before the baby arrives. 'Get some sleep because jumping from one child to two is a big step,' said Beckham during an appearance on ITV's Lorraine, who then confessed that going from two to three was an even bigger leap. The Duchess, who is currently suffering from acute morning sickness, is thought to want three children by the age of 35. Beckham's words of support came as Kensington Palace announced that the Duchess will not be attending tonight's Invictus Games opening ceremony and that her trip to Malta next week is 'under review'. Kate, who suffered from the same extreme morning sickness during her last pregnancy, is expected to give birth in the Spring. Beckham, who has known the Duke of Cambridge for a number of years and was a guest at the Royal Wedding in 2011, is also in the running to be a godparent for the couple's second child. According to bookmakers William Hill, Beckham boasts odds of 16 to one to become a godparent - as does his wife Victoria. Other favourites include Prince Harry, Pippa Middleton, Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall. Long shots include David Cameron and Boris Johnson at 66/1. Godfather or not, Beckham also revealed that he was left delighted by the royal baby news and said that the couple are 'great parents'. 'I\u2019m so happy for them both because they\u2019re such great parents and obviously to be great parents and to have the roles that they have, as important as they have, is really incredible,' he said.

It was the wish of Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul, to create a reward to commend civilians and soldiers and from this wish was instituted a \"\", a body of men that was not an order of chivalry, for Napoleon believed France wanted a recognition of merit rather than a new system of nobility. The however did use the organization of old French orders of chivalry for example the \"Ordre de Saint-Louis\". The badges of the legion also bear a resemblance to the , which also used a red ribbon. \n\nNapoleon originally created this to ensure political loyalty. The organization would be used as a facade to give political favours, gifts, and concessions. The was loosely patterned after a Roman legion, with legionaries, officers, commanders, regional \"cohorts\" and a grand council.

Musicians use the guitar for almost all kinds of music. Country and western music would not be the same without a guitar. The traditional Spanish folk music called Flamenco could not exist without a guitar. The sound of American blues music would not be the same without the sad cry of the guitar. And rock and roll music would almost be impossible without this instrument. \n\nMusic experts do not agree about where the guitar was first played. Most agree it is ancient. Some experts say an instrument very much like a guitar was played in Egypt more than 1,000 years ago. Most experts say that the ancestor of the modern guitar was brought to Spain from Persia sometime in the 12thcentury. The guitar continued to develop in Spain. In the 1700s it became similar to the instrument we know today. \n\nMany famous musicians played the instrument. The famous Italian violins Niccole Paganism played and wrote music for the guitar in the early 1800s. Franz Schubert used the guitar to write some of his famous works. In modern times Spanish guitarist Andres Segovia helped make the instrument extremely popular. \n\nIn the 1930s, Les Paul began experimenting to make an electric guitar. He invented the solid-bodied electric guitar in 1946. The Gibson Guitar Company began producing its famous Les Paul Guitar in 1952. It became a powerful influence on popular music. The instrument has the same shape and the same six strings as the traditional guitar, but it sounds very different. Les Paul produced a series of extremely popular recordings that introduced the public to this music. Listen to this Les Paul recording.

The friend in question is K.\n\nI met Y and K in first year of university, when they were both single, and had what I think was a pretty good friendship with both of them individually for about a year before they started dating.\n\nThey saw each other for about four years, seeing each other through graduation and eventually getting an apartment together. This is through our undergrad years (still quite a developmental time). They were easily two of my closest friends as individuals.\n\nBreakup context: K started a new program at school, with which came a new set of friends. Y's work had him out of town for weeks at a time, so K is often at their shared apartment on her own. Relationship appears to get a little rocky. The distance and time apart seems to be doing nobody any favours.\n\nOne of the new friends K meets is a guy that she gets close with, call him M. I hear from K that M has a poor opinion of K's boyfriend Y (my friend), and their relationship. M's comments appear to be regular. I hear all this from K, and tell her at the time that those sound like red flags of someone who's trying to split a couple up so he can slot in. M has admitted to doing exactly that before. Y is obviously in arms about the whole thing.\n\nAbout 4 months into this arrangement (shared apartment, new job and new program) things come to a head and K calls it quits. It's messy because they're in the middle of the lease, and it's taxing on everyone. K and Y can both be stubborn and argumentative, and that's the side that comes out.\n\nI had a suspicion that M was the driving force behind K breaking up. This is just from how K has described M to be. Without any evidence I gave K the benefit of the doubt and tried to be as supportive as I could to both K and Y.\n\nI see Y often and we talk as often as we normally do. Communication with K drops off a cliff. Months later, I heard that K and M hooked up very soon after the breakup (approx 1 week).\n\nI think I enough for me to say K ignored the red flags we showed her months ago, and purposely played right into M's hands, hurting my friend Y in the process. So I decide I'm not interested in hanging out with K anymore (not a big deal, since she's cut me off anyway).\n\nA couple of years later, they're broken up and I hear through the grapevine she's apologetic and wants to reach out again. Our other mutual friends are all closer with Y than K, or vice versa and that dictates their opinion. I'm trying to stick to my guns. \n\nI'm in her town this weekend with some mutual friends for an unrelated reason, and this is affecting our plans (some want to catch up with her, some don't care...

It is based on the principle of superposition, which states that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This is ", "rejected": "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a framework for understanding the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It emerged in the early 20th century when scientists discovered that classical physics could not adequately explain phenomena observed at these scales.\n\nAt the heart of quantum mechanics is the concept of wave-particle duality, which states that particles, such as electrons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This is exemplified by the famous double-slit experiment, where electrons passing through two slits create an interference pattern on a screen, just as light waves do.\n\nAnother key principle in quantum mechanics is the superposition of states, which means that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. Upon measurement, the system collapses into one of the possible states, as described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. This wave function provides the probabilities of finding the system in different states.\n\nQuantum entanglement is another counterintuitive phenomenon that arises in quantum mechanics. It occurs when two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle depends on the state of the other, even when separated by large distances. This has been experimentally demonstrated through Bell's theorem and is the basis for emerging quantum technologies, such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.\n\nQuantum mechanics also follows the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with perfect precision. This inherent uncertainty has profound implications for our understanding of nature at the quantum scale.\n\nIn conclusion, quantum mechanics is a revolutionary theory that has transformed our understanding of the microscopic world, revealing a realm governed by probabilities and inherent uncertainties. It has led to groundbreaking discoveries and technologies, such as transistors, lasers, and superconductors, that have shaped the modern world. Despite its success, quantum mechanics remains a deeply mysterious and fascinating field, with many unsolved questions and potential applications yet to be explored.", "source": "lmsys"}, {"prompt": "I am laying concrete 'stones' for a patio in my back yard.

How many more boys than girls are there?\nA: The class was divided into 3 + 2 = 5 parts. So each part is equal to 100 / 5 = 20 students. Since there are 3 parts for boys, then there are 20 x 3 = 60 boys in class. So there are 100 - 60 = 40 girls in class. Hence, there are 60 - 40 = 20 boys more than girls. The answer is 20.\nQuestion: Jerry's breakfast includes 6 pancakes with 120 calories each, two strips of bacon with 100 calories each, and a bowl of cereal with 200 calories. How many calories is his breakfast total?\nAnswer: First find the total number of calories in the pancakes: 6 pancakes * 120 calories / pancake = 720 calories. Then find the total number of calories in the bacon: 2 strips * 100 calories / strip = 200 calories. Then add the number of calories in each food to find the total number of calories: 720 calories + 200 calories + 200 calories = 1120 calories. The answer is 1120.\n[Question]There are 3/5 times as many people living in Boise as the number living in Seattle. There are 4000 more people in Lake View than the population in Seattle. If Lake View's population is 24000, calculate the total population of the three cities.\n[Answer]If Lake View's population is 24000, then there are 24000 - 4000 = 20000 people living in Seattle. The total population of Seattle and Lake view is 20000 + 24000 = 44000. Since the population in Boise is 3 / 5 times that of Seattle, there are 3 / 5 * 20000 = 12000 people living in Boise. The three cities have a total population of 44000 + 12000 = 56000. The answer is 56000.\nQ: Jenine can sharpen a pencil 5 times before it runs out. She needs to sharpen a pencil for every 1.5 hours of use. She already has ten pencils and needs to write for 105 hours. A new pencil costs $2. How much does she need to spend on more pencils to be able to write for 105 hours?\nA: A pencil last 7.5 hours because 5 x 1.5 = 7.5. The pencils she has will last 75 hours because 10 x 7.5 = 75. She needs 30 more hours of writing because 105 - 75 = 30. She will need 4 more pencils to reach this because 30 / 7.5 = 4. She will spend $8 on pencils because 4 x 2 = 8.

If the number of zombies doubled every day, how many days ago were there less than 50 zombies in the mall?\nAnswer: First find how many zombies there were one day ago: 480 zombies / 2 = 240 zombies. Then find how many zombies there were two days ago: 240 zombies / 2 = 120 zombies. Then find the number of zombies there were three days ago: 120 zombies / 2 = 60 zombies. Then find the number of zombies there were four days ago: 60 zombies / 2 = 30 zombies, which is less than 50, so there were less than 50 zombies 4 days ago.

Avoid creating questions that (i) can't be answered correctly without actually understanding the passage and (ii) uses the same words or phrases given in the passage.\n\nLet me give you an example: Context: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease with an uncertain pathogenesis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 \u00b1 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).\nAnswer: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.\nThe answer to this example can be: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?\nHere is why: The question is based on the following sentences from the two passages (i) Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) {ii) In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (iii) As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. and (iv) ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia.\n\nOK. solve this:\nContext: An imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission underlies the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. Agonists of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR2/3, have been proposed as novel therapeutic agents to correct this imbalance. However, the influence of mGluR2/3 activity on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors has not been explored.', 'We aimed to investigate the ability of a novel mGluR2/3 agonist, LY379268, to modulate the availability of the excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) and the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyrate-A receptor (GABAA-R), in a two-hit mouse model of schizophrenia.', 'Wild type (WT) and heterozygous neuregulin 1 transmembrane domain mutant mice (NRG1 HET) were treated daily with phencyclidine (10 mg/kg ip) or saline for 14 days. After a 14-day washout, an acute dose of the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 (3 mg/kg), olanzapine (antipsychotic drug comparison, 1.5 mg/kg), or saline was administered. NMDA-R and GABAA-R binding densities were examined by receptor autoradiography in several schizophrenia-relevant brain regions.', 'In both WT and NRG1 HET mice, phencyclidine treatment significantly reduced NMDA-R and GABAA-R binding density in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens. Acute treatment with LY379268 restored NMDA-R and GABAA-R levels in the two-hit mouse model comparable to olanzapine.\nAnswer: We demonstrate that the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 restores excitatory and inhibitory deficits with similar efficiency as olanzapine in our two-hit schizophrenia mouse model. This study significantly contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of LY379268 and supports the use of agents aimed at mGluR2/3.\nAnswer:", "chosen": "What is the effect of the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 on NMDA-R and GABAA-R availability in a two-hit schizophrenia mouse model?", "rejected": "Great!

Tom Wolf and Republican Scott Wagner in Hershey , Pa., Monday, Oct. 1, 2018. The debate was hosted by the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry.\nIt's hard to decisively win a 45-minute gubernatorial debate: There's simply not enough time to make key points and thoroughly own the issues.\nBut you can certainly lose the debate, especially if you're the moderator.\nThat's what happened Monday night at the Hershey Lodge, when Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek made a guest appearance as celebrity moderator of Pennsylvania's one and only debate between Gov. Wolf, a Democrat, and Republican Scott Wagner.\nThe debate started late as Trebek lingered on stage during a \"fireside chat\" with Gene Barr, president of the state Chamber of Business and Industry, which hosted the event. Then, when the main event finally came, the game-show host filibustered and monopolized the whole thing \u2014 which seemed fine to the front-runner Wolf but cut into Wagner's attempt to capitalize on a statewide audience for the lone debate.\nTrebek abandoned a veneer of impartiality when it came to whether Pennsylvania should impose a severance tax on natural gas drilling. Wolf has pushed the tax since he took office in 2015, but the GOP-led legislature has blocked his efforts. Wagner and other Republicans note that Pennsylvania already imposes an \"impact fee\" on drillers.\nWagner marshaled that argument Monday, but Trebek suggested it wasn't enough.\nThat was a remarkably unpopular opinion to push to the Chamber of Business and Industry crowd, which responded with boos. \"What did I tell you guys at the beginning?\" Trebek said (his one rule: no booing or hissing).\n\"If all of the voters were to believe everything you've said about each other, we'd have trouble voting for either one of you,\" Trebek told the candidates. Fair enough \u2014 voters often say they're sick of attack ads. But Trebek came across as moralizing, and it's not clear why his opinion should matter to Pennsylvania voters.\nAt one point, Trebek asked: \"Have you ever said anything negative about your opponent that you knew was not true?\"\nWagner shook his head no, and Wolf offered a lawyerlike equivocation: \"Not that I remember, no.\"\nTrebek began to frame a question about redistricting, noting that the legislature had made scores of amendments to a reform bill and suggesting lawmakers had no interest in actually changing the process.\nThen he said the only institution less popular in the Keystone State than the legislature was the Catholic Church, which, of course, has been under fire since a grand jury in August reported decades of abuse by predator priests.\nThe audience seemed to let out an audible cringe.\n\"Don't go there,\" Trebek said, before launching into a soliloquy about his time at a Catholic boarding school.\nAs Trebek moved on, Wolf interjected, to laughter, \"I don't think you quite finished on the redistricting.\"\nThe Pennsylvania Cable Network is not the place for this. If you watch PCN, you're expecting the sometimes dry and technical but important details of state government policy debate.

Copyright law protects original works of authorship, including art. The Copyright Office has stated that \"the style of an artist's work is protectable by copyright.\" This means that an artist can prevent others from copying or using their distinctive style without ", "rejected": "Artistic styles themselves are generally not copyrightable. Copyright law protects specific creative works, such as a particular painting, song, or book. But styles, techniques, and ideas are not protected. For example:\n\n\u2022 An impressionistic painting style is not copyrightable, but a specific impressionistic painting, like Van Gogh's The Starry Night, is protected by copyright.\n\n\u2022 A musical style like jazz or blues is not copyrightable, but a specific jazz or blues song can be copyrighted.\n\n\u2022 An architectural style like Gothic Revival is not copyrightable, but the design of a specific Gothic Revival building can be protected.\n\nHowever, there are a few exceptions and nuances:\n\n\u2022 If a style is very closely associated with a particular artist, it may receive some protection. For example, Andy Warhol's pop art style was considered distinctive enough to be partially copyrightable. But in general, most artistic styles and techniques are free for others to build upon.\n\n\u2022 Elements of a work that are purely aesthetic or have limited creative expression may not be copyrightable, even if incorporated into a specific work. For example, basic geometric shapes, colors, or short musical phrases may not qualify for copyright.\n\n\u2022 A work must exhibit a minimum level of creativity to be copyrightable. Mere variations of uncopyrightable elements like styles, ideas, or public domain works may not meet the creativity threshold. But a highly complex and creative variation could be copyrightable.\n\n\u2022 Titles, names, and short phrases are not copyrightable, even if incorporated into a larger copyrightable work. For example, book series titles cannot be copyrighted.\n\nSo in summary, while copyright protects specific creative works, it generally does not extend to the artistic styles, techniques, ideas, concepts, and other uncopyrightable elements employed in those works. But there are a few limited exceptions for highly distinctive and creative variations.", "source": "lmsys"}, {"prompt": "How does the process of volcanic formation occur in Java? Can you provide an explanation using Java code?\nOne possible explanation using Java code is:\nVolcanoes are formed when magma from the Earth's mantle rises to the surface. This magma is under intense pressure and when it reaches the surface, it is released as lava, ash, and gases. The lava cools and hardens into solid rock, creating a cone-shaped structure.\nTo simulate this process in Java, we can create a program that generates a cone shape using OpenGL. We can then add texture to the surface of the cone to simulate the appearance of lava and ash.\nHere is an example Java code snippet that generates a cone shape using OpenGL:\nimport org.lwjgl.opengl.Display;\nimport org.lwjgl.opengl.DisplayMode;\nimport org.lwjgl.opengl.GL11;\npublic class Volcano {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        Display.setDisplayMode(new DisplayMode(800, 600));\n        Display.create();\n        GL11.glMatrixMode(GL11.GL_PROJECTION);\n        GL11.glLoadIdentity();\n        GL11.glOrtho(-10, 10, -10, 10, -10, 10);\n        GL11.glMatrixMode(GL11.GL_MODELVIEW);\n        while (!Display.isCloseRequested()) {\n            GL11.glClear(GL11.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL11.GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);\n            GL11.glPushMatrix();\n            GL11.glTranslatef(0, 0, -5);\n            GL11.glRotatef(90, 1, 0, 0);\n            GL11.glBegin(GL11.GL_TRIANGLES);\n            for (int i = 0; i < 360; i += 10) {\n                GL11.glColor3f(1, 0, 0);\n                GL11.glVertex3f(0, 0, 0);\n                GL11.glColor3f(1, 1, 0);\n                GL11.glVertex3f((float) Math.cos(Math.toRadians(i)), (float) Math.sin(Math.toRadians(i)), 1);\n                GL11.glColor3f(0, 1, 0);\n                GL11.glVertex3f((float) Math.cos(Math.toRadians(i + 10)), (float) Math.sin(Math.toRadians(i + 10)), 1);\n            }\n            GL11.glEnd();\n            GL11.glPopMatrix();\n            Display.update();\n            Display.sync(60);\n        }\n        Display.destroy();\n    }\n} \nThis code creates a cone-shaped object using OpenGL and displays it on the screen.

So, finding simple ideas that make a gift POP that don\u2019t take any effort (shh don\u2019t tell!), like this one, are right up my alley.\nThese handmade Christmas gift tags are a really simple way to dress up a gift. Here\u2019s a quick tutorial how to make them.\nI used the circle die for my Sizzix Big Shot machine to cut out the circles but you do not have to have one of these to make these tags. Use a compass, or any small round object and trace around. My circles are 4cm in diameter.\nFirst draw the top of the bauble and the line down the centre of the tag.\nGlue your circle and place it on the tag so it slightly overlaps the black lines.\nAttach some ribbon or baker\u2019s twine to the top of the tag and write a personal message on the other side.\nIf you've been scrolling through Pinterest and come across some of the folded-paper decor trends, then you've likely come across these paper diamonds. Made in bright and colourful paper, or in striking monochrome prints, they look fab stuck to the wall or a bed headboard with a piece of washi tape. Just look at how these ones are styled, made by Origami Est, author of Paper Home.\nThese gorgeous paper diamonds are a fun way to add colour and dimension to a room. Pile them on a mantle, display them on a tray on the coffee table or sideboard, hand them from a shelf or washi-tape them directly on a wall. This origami paper trend is a beaut and are relatively simple to make. Ready to give it a try?\nThe fiddliest part of the whole process is definitely glueing the two halves together. I found that going easy on the glue helps, and trying not to apply it too close to the outside edge, in case of any overflow.\nAnyone else jumping onto this paper trend?\nI love paper cutting. I also love my mom. So I whipped up this template for a lovely paper cut Mother's Day card just in time for you all to make your mom's lovely handmade Mother's Day cards.\nIf you're reading this from the US, you're probably thinking, \"Say what? Mother's Day is in May!\" And you're right. But since I'm Canadian, living in London, I get to celebrate this lovely day twice a year.\nLet's get started on our cards, shall we?\n1. Download and print the card template at 100%. Cut it out along the dotted lines. Open your card and lay your sheet of graphite paper face down on the left-hand side of the open card. Then lay your template face up on top of it. We're transferring our design in reverse on the inside of the card so that we don't have to go back and rub out the graphite marks on the front of the card.\n2. Using a pencil or pen, trace along all the lines of the template to transfer the design. If you lose track of where you've traced and where you haven't, simply hold tight onto one corner so the template doesn't move and life up the transfer paper.\n3. Once your design has been transferred, it's time to cut! It's important to have a sharp blade when paper cutting in order to get a nice, clean finish. Take it slow and cut with a constant and firm pressure.\n4. When you have finished cutting out your design, admire your knife skills from the front of the card. So pretty, right? If you need to tidy up any edges, just turn the card over and clean up some of the cuts. If your edges look a bit ragged, it's probably time to change the blade in your knife, or use firmer pressure while cutting.\n5. Next, cut a piece of decorative paper slightly smaller than the size of the card. In our case that would be 12.5cm x 12.5cm. Use a glue stick around the edge of the design and in a few places in the middle and stick your paper pretty side down so that it shows on the front of the card.\n6. You're done! Write a sweet message for your mom on the inside and tuck it into an envelope.\nShare your handmade cards with us!
